# BiomimeticEye

* code not written by me (add names)
* I've just added code to call an executable and interface with the eye

* all of the code was in one main file, about 10,000 lines long
* I've broken it down into smaller files

* this is a Visual Studio 10 project
	* I'll host the code, dependencies, and VS10 installer somewhere so others can run the code if they want
